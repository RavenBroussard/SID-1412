<p>I spend my days working in an electronic store.  Mostly, I handle the repair and sales for cellphones.  I enjoy this job very much and would love to teach the other employees how to handle a phone customer.</p>
<p>I am want to make a perfect system for my coworkers to help a customer with their phones.  I feel by doing so I would be able to focus on other things.  </p>
<p>I want this to work, but I don't want to be replaced by it.  And if I am remember I did it and I need my check please.</p>
